## v1.33.0

A minor release that turns the `mobile/` gomobile bindings into a full on-device
editor: a Swift/Kotlin app can now mutate the document locally, observe committed
changes to drive its UI, and read idiomatic Yjs JSON straight from the accessors.
No breaking changes to the core library.

### Added

- **On-device editing for the mobile bindings**
  ([#118](https://github.com/reearth/ygo/issues/118)): `mobile.Doc` gains
  gomobile-safe mutators — `InsertText`, `InsertTextWithAttributes`, `DeleteText`,
  `FormatText`, `InsertArray`, `DeleteArray`, `SetMap`, `DeleteMapKey` — each
  validated and transaction-wrapped, returning an error (never panicking) on bad
  input. A Swift/Kotlin app is now a full editor, not just a viewer.

- **Push change-notifications for the mobile bindings**
  ([#119](https://github.com/reearth/ygo/issues/119)): `Doc.Observe` delivers the
  V1 update bytes plus a `local` flag after each committed transaction;
  `Awareness.Observe` delivers `{added,updated,removed}` client-id sets. Delivery
  is on a background goroutine; `Subscription.Close()` unsubscribes and all
  observers detach on `Doc`/`Awareness` `Close`.

### Changed

- **Idiomatic Yjs JSON from the mobile read accessors**
  ([#109](https://github.com/reearth/ygo/issues/109)): `Doc.GetTextJSON` now emits
  idiomatic single-op Yjs delta (`[{"insert":"hi","attributes":{...}}]`) and
  `Awareness.StatesJSON` emits `{"<clientID>": <state>}` without the internal
  clock. These reshape two accessors previously documented as unstable.
